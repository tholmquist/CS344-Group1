		<h1>Studying Tips and Advice for Doing Well in School</h1>
			<p>It's a <a href="http://www.npr.org/2013/05/10/182861382/the-myth-of-multitasking" target="_blank">myth</a> that multitasking makes you more productive. It's best to study by focusing on one task at a time with as little distraction as possible (music is not
			necessarily distracting - some people find it helps get them into study mode - but Netflix always is). If your environment is distracting study in the library.</p>
				
			<p>Reviewing notes consistently before bed is a good way to remember information.</p>
				
			<p>However you like to study make it a habit instead of trying to learn everything before a test. To motivate yourself to study think about how you feel when
				you are prepared for a test vs. unprepared. Chase that feeling.</p>
				
			<p>There is such a thing as too much studying at once! There is only so much information that you can cram into your brain in one session. Take a break, get a snack, go 
				for a short walk every few hours, etc. while studying.</p>
				
			<p>Studying is not everything. Most aha moments do not happen when you're staring at a textbook too tired to understand what you're reading. If a problem is making you
				frustrated the best thing often is to take a break or even sleep on it.</p>
				
			<p>Keep a sense of perspective. Once you get your first job very few people will care how  you did in school, what classes you took, what school you went to, or if you
				had to repeat a class.</p>
				
			<p>Try to get 7 - 8 hours of sleep a night. Your brain simply works better when it is well rested. Your brain also works best when it is well fed - taking
				a test when you haven't eaten yet is a bad idea! Eating a well balanced breakfast everyday can be hard so have some candy or fruit on hand on test days (glucose temporary improves concentration and memory).</p>
				
			<p>Have faith in yourself. Often people fail because they never really try. Research shows that the brain is plastic - we are always able to learn new things. Doing well
				in school and life is determined by effort not innate intelligence.</p>
				
			<p>Most schools have some kind of service that will teach you how to study well or even a class - take advantage!</p>
				
			<p>Not all learning happens in a classroom or while studying. Having a social life is important.</p>
				
			<p>If you're feeling the effects of stress too much or need someone to talk to your school probably has a counselling center. Remember they exist to serve you and what you to seek help if you need it.</p>
