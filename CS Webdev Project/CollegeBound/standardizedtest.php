			<h1>Standardized Tests!</h1>
			<p>Standardized tests are an import part of applying to college. These test are used by schools to determine: admittance, scholarships, 
				and starting classes. Colleges put a heavy importance on these test and as such, so should you. The two main standardized 
				tests are the SAT and ACT. The SAT is used mainly on the East Coast and West Coast and by highly selective colleges and universities.
				 The ACT is used mainly in the in Midwest. For example, the University of Maryland uses the SAT on the application while 
				Winona State University uses the ACT. So, depending on which school you want to apply is the determining factor on which 
				test you should take. There is nothing wrong with taking both tests to keep options open! </p>

			<h2>The ACT</h2>
			<p>The ACT is most likely going to be the standardized test that you will be taking. The test assesses four areas of skill: English, Reading,
			 Mathematics, Science, and an optional Writing section. The English section will measure your ability to comprehend written English and your
			 rhetorical skills. The Reading section is just a simple measure of how well you can read and understand information presented to you in a 
			given amount of time. The Mathematics section will test your ability to perform mathematical calculations learned in class up to the
			 beginning of twelfth grade. All the math you have taken up to grade twelve will be on the test, but do not worry, most of it is just
			 algebra. The Science section measures the interpretation, analysis, evaluation, reasoning, and problem-solving skills required in the 
			natural sciences. The Writing section measures writing skills emphasized in high school English classes and in entry-level college 
			composition courses.</p>
