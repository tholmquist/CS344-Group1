			Kids First is as afterschool program serving Maplewood residents who are in kindergarten through 12th 

grade. It is staffed by WSU student volunteers and provides assistance with homework, tutoring, and 

recreational activities. We also provide snacks. Kids First has been helping the community for the last 8 

years and currently there are about 100 kids in the program, with a daily attendance of around 50 kids. 

Our goal is to prepare Maplewood residents for university and long term success in life. 

Kids first follows Winona State University schedule however we do close if the local school district calls a 

snow day [this http://www.winona.k12.mn.us/ site will put up a notice if it’s a snow day]. Our Fall term 

is Tuesday, September 1st – Thursday, December 3rd 2015. Kids First will be closed on Labor Day (09/07), 

Veterans Day (11/11), & Thanksgiving (11/25 & 11/26). Otherwise we are opened Monday – Thursday, 

2:30 – 6:30 p.m. 

Notes: need dates for spring, and are they open in summer? And do they have an official mission 

statement?
